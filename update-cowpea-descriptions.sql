Characteristics: more erect plant habit than California Blackeye 5; seeds are typical blackeye type, cream seed coat with black pigment around hilum; seed smaller than California Blackeye 5, 19-20 gm per 100 seed vs. 23 gm per 100 seed; 90 day maturity to dry seed; canning qualities comparable to California Blackeye 5 and California Blackeye 3; yields comparable to or better than those of California Blackeye 5. Resistance: Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. tracheiphilum race 3, homozygous for the Rk root knot nematode resistance gene. Crop Sci. 31:1703, 1991. 1987.' WHERE variety='CB46';

UPDATE organism SET description='IT00K-1263 is high yielding and stays green under drought in Mozambique and Nigeria, with dark-brown seed.' WHERE variety='IT00K-1263';

UPDATE organism SET description='IT93K-503-1, a breeding line from the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA) breeding nursery in Nigeria, is draught tolerant and resistant to root-knot nematodes, M. phaseolina and Fusarium wilt.' WHERE variety='IT93K-503-1';

UPDATE organism SET description='California Blackeye 27 (or CB27) is ideally suited to the Central Valley of California and other areas where hot weather occurs during flowering. This cultivar also produces higher blackeye bean yields in areas where races 3 and 4 of Fusarium wilt or aggressive biotypes of root-knot nematodes (like Meloidogyne incognita and M. Javanica) are present. Nematode populations in the soil are reduced following cultivation of CB27, conferring benefits to subsequent nematode susceptible crops. Therefore, CB27 is an excellent candidate for use in an annual crop rotation cycle in areas where control of root-knot nematodes is necessary.' WHERE variety='CB27';

UPDATE organism SET description='Cowpea (Vigna unguiculata) is used in many parts of the world for its high-protein seeds, but also for its nutrient-rich edible leaves, forage, and soil enrichment. Cowpea is generally more heat-tolerant than common bean. Cowpeas are one of the most important food legume crops in the semi-arid tropics that cover Asia, Africa, southern Europe and Central and South America. A drought-tolerant and warm-weather crop, cowpeas are well-adapted to the drier regions of the tropics, where other food legumes do not perform as well. It also has the useful ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through its root nodules, and it grows well in poor soils.' WHERE variety='IT97K-499-35';
