'Tifrunner (Reg. no. CV-93, PI 644011) is a runner-type peanut (Arachis hypogaea L. subsp. hypogaea var. hypogaea) cultivar that was released by the USDA-ARS and the Georgia Agricultural Experiment Stations in 2005. Tifrunner originated from a cross of F439-16-10-3 and PI 203396. Tifrunner is a runner market-type in seed and pod size. It has a spreading runner growth habit with an erect mainstem that is prominent throughout the growing season and at harvest. It has a high level of resistance to TSWV, and moderate resistance to early (Cercosporidium arachidicola Hori) and late leaf spot. It is a late maturity class peanut, with about 150 d needed for optimal maturity.'

'California Blackeye 27 (or CB27) is ideally suited to the Central Valley of California and other areas where hot weather occurs during flowering. This cultivar also produces higher blackeye bean yields in areas where races 3 and 4 of Fusarium wilt or aggressive biotypes of root-knot nematodes (like Meloidogyne incognita and M. Javanica) are present. Nematode populations in the soil are reduced following cultivation of CB27, conferring benefits to subsequent nematode susceptible crops.

'Cowpea (Vigna unguiculata) is used in many parts of the world for its high-protein seeds, but also for its nutrient-rich edible leaves, forage, and soil enrichment. Cowpea is generally more heat-tolerant than common bean. Cowpeas are one of the most important food legume crops in the semi-arid tropics that cover Asia, Africa, southern Europe and Central and South America. A drought-tolerant and warm-weather crop, cowpeas are well-adapted to the drier regions of the tropics, where other food legumes do not perform as well. It also has the useful ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through its root nodules, and it grows well in poor soils.'
